# Array-Animation
This project was created for a school assignment. The goal of the assignment was to write a Python program that uses arrays to animate a cluster of graphical objects so that it creates an interesting or entertaining scene. I decided to animate a scene with a cartoon cat and a popcorn machine. I animated the popcorn using arrays by drawing the objects, updating their positions, updating the screen and sleeping,and deleting them. I'm very satisfied with how the final product turned out and I think this is one of my best code projects yet.
